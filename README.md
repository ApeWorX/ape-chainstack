# Quick Start

Chainstack network provider plugins.

This plugin allows using the Ape framework with Chainstack as a node provider in an easy and integrated way.

Ape is an innovative smart contract development and testing framework.
It is inspired by Brownie, and it has essentially the same syntax.
Still, Ape focuses on a more modular approach, allowing us to build and use external plugins to add functionality.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- Windows Subsystem Linux ([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) if operating on windows.

### Dependencies

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads) version 3.8 or greater
- python3-dev

  - MacOS. Should already have the [correct headers if Python is installed with `brew`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32578106/how-to-install-python-devel-in-mac-os)

  - Linux. Install python3-dev with:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install python3-dev
  ```

> **Note:** Always check the [Ape docs to find the updated requirements](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/quickstart.html#prerequisite).

## Installation

Verify the Python version installed:

```sh
Python3 --version
```

### Virtual environment

It is recommended to operate in a virtual environment; you will need to [install Ape](https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape#installation) in the virtual environment if you decide to use one.

Create a virtual environment.

```sh
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/environment
```

> Keep in mind that you can place the virtual environment where you prefer.

Then activate it.

```sh
source /bin/activate
```

### Install ape-chainstack via `pip`

You can install the latest release via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install ape-chainstack
```

### Install ape-chainstack via `setuptools`

You can clone the repository and use [`setuptools`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) for the most up-to-date version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape-chainstack.git
cd ape-chainstack
python3 setup.py install
```

Verify that the Chainstack plugin was installed correctly with this command:

```bash
ape plugins list
```

It will show a list of all the plugins installed, and Chainstack will be there.

```bash
Installed Plugins:
  chainstack    <current version number>
```

## Quick Usage

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a node, and find your endpoint credentials:

1. [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
1. [Deploy a node](https://docs.chainstack.com/platform/join-a-public-network).
1. [View node access and credentials](https://docs.chainstack.com/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

> **Note:** At this moment only the Ethereum network is supported.

Create an environment variable with your Chainstack node URL in this format `CHAINSTACK_"NETWORK"_URL=ENDPOINT_URL`; for example:

```sh
export CHAINSTACK_GOERLI_URL=https://nd-11X-26X-16X.p2pify.com/YOUR_API_KEY
```

Use the command `ape networks list` to see the networks available:

```sh
ethereum  (default)
├── mainnet
│   ├── geth  (default)
│   └── chainstack
├── ropsten
│   ├── geth  (default)
│   └── chainstack
├── kovan
│   └── geth  (default)
├── rinkeby
│   ├── geth  (default)
│   └── chainstack
├── goerli
│   ├── geth  (default)
│   └── chainstack
└── local  (default)
    ├── geth
    └── test  (default)
```

Use the `--network` command to access the console using your node; for example:

```bash
ape console --network ethereum:goerli:chainstack
```

Check the Ape docs to see [how to select a network](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/networks.html).

Now you are ready to use Ape to develop and test your smart contract, checkout the [Ape Academy](https://academy.apeworx.io/) for tutorials.
